# Music-Metadata-Linter

## How to run
* Currently you will have to download the project as a zip and have python3 installed (the project was created using 3.10.2)

* Then create a folder in the project folder called `working-dir` 

* Move the files you want to be converted into the new folder and run `metadata_linter.py`

## Common Problems
* errors after running program

Anything in the directory that is not a `.mp3` file will cause an error, however errors are handled correctly.
