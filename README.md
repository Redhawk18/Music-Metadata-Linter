# Music-Metadata-Linter

## What is this
This is a script I wrote to convert song metadata titles in mass like for example `Come Together (Remastered 2009)` becomes `Come Together`

## How to run
* Have mutagen libary installed 

for Windows

`py -m pip install mutagen`

for Unix

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


* Currently you will have to download the project as a zip and have python3 installed (the project was created using 3.10.2)

* Run `metadata_linter.py` it should create a folder on first run

* Move the files you want to be converted into the `working-dir` folder

## Common Problems
* Don't have none .flac's or mp3's in your directory
