# Music-Metadata-Linter

## What is this
This is a script I wrote to convert song metadata titles in mass like for example `Come Together (Remastered 2009)` becomes `Come Together`

#

## How to run
* Have Python installed

Windows

`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Linux

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


* Double click `metadata_linter.py` it should create a folder on first run

* Move the files you want to be converted into the `working-dir` folder
