# Music-Metadata-Linter

## How to run
* Have mutagen libary installed 

for Windows

`py -m pip install mutagen`

for Unix

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


* Currently you will have to download the project as a zip and have python3 installed (the project was created using 3.10.2)

* Run `metadata_linter.py` it should create a folder on first run

* Move the files you want to be converted into the `working-dir` folder

## Common Problems
Currently only `.mp3`'s are converted, however `.flac` support is planned
